    <string name="r1">This game is based from cellular automaton devised by <b>John Horton Conway</b> in 1970.\n\n
         <b>Grid</b> shows cells that can reproduce or die.\n
         - A cell dies if it has less than 2 or more than 3 adjacent neighbors. The dead cells are black.\n
         - A cell born in an empty box if it has exactly 3 neighbors. New cells are red.\n\n
         You can either play alone with green cells or cells play against purple.\n\n
         <b>Virus</b> are available to act on the life cycle of the grid cells. A virus can:\n
         - Kill cells,\n
         - Boost births cells,\n
         - Freeze cells.\n
         A virus has a life cycle and a radius of propagation.\n\n
         <b>Game settings:</b>\n
         - Density: population density of the initial grid (1 sparsely populated, 10 overcrowded).\n
         - Delay: display time in ms of each cycle.\n
         - Difficulty: number of viruses available.\n
         - Game mode: step by step or automatic.</string>
